Welcome to Cloud9ine!

This is a basic weather website that makes use of public weather data from Open-Meteo's API to display live weather data for various locations across the UK, as well as the hourly forecast for each day within the next 7 days.


HOW TO USE:
1) Click on a city on the map to open the current weather display page for that location. If your local town or city is not on the map, try searching for it in the search bar in the top right corner.
2) The weather displayed is the summary of the weather for the current day. NOTE: OBVIOUSLY this is subject to change throughout the day, and therefore users wishing to view data for a specific hour should navigate to the bottom of the page, where there is a brieff display of specific conditions at each hour of the day.
3) Opening the side panel located on the right-hand side of the screen will open up the forecast for the next week. Select the day you want, then scroll down to the bottom to view hourly weather data for that day. NOTE: the day summary for days other than the current day is often inaccurate, as it takes data from a point in the day rather than a mean etc, so viewing the hourly forecast is recommended.
4) To navigate to a different day's weather display, simply re-open the side-bar and select another day.
5) Finally, when wishing to leave the weather display section, simply click the back button near the bottom-left corner of the page. Alternatively, you can also click the Cloud9ine logo at the top left corner, within the main bar at the top of the screen, to always take you back to the home page.


The "Info" page:
If you want to read more about why, and how i created the website, click the information logo in the centre of the main bar at the top to access the information page, a section containing a more-in depth explanation of my goals and more.


A note about locations and images:
Obviosuly i have not been able to add every UK town and city in existance. If your city/town is not on the list, there is a chance i will eventually get round to adding it, but in the mean time, simply check the weather for the nearest location that has been added. There is a list of locations that have been added at the bottom of the info page. In terms of images, there are several that need to be added for each location, meaning it is likely that when searching for your town/city, either the small preview image in the search bar suggestions box, or the main screen-width image of the location is missing.




Extra:
- When trying to access data about a particular location, you could type in the name of the place, followed by the day (starting from day 0 (current day)) at the end of the URL using the following template: "place=x&day=y", and an appropriate error message will be displayed if the location does not exist, was not provided, or cannot be accessed.
